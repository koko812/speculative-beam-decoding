# 🚀 Speculative Beam Decoding: Combining Speed and Quality in Language Generation

This repository explores the combination of **Speculative Decoding** and **Beam Search** for efficient and high-quality language generation using Transformer-based language models.

---

## 📌 Motivation

While **Speculative Decoding** accelerates generation by leveraging a fast draft model and validating outputs with a slower, more accurate target model, **Beam Search** improves output quality through breadth in candidate exploration.

This project investigates:
- How speculative decoding can **bootstrap multiple beams** efficiently
- How beam search can **refine rejected completions** from speculative drafts
- The trade-offs in **speed vs. coherence/quality** when combining both

## 🧠 Conceptual Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Prompt] --> B{Draft Model}
    B --> C[Drafted Beams (Top-k)]
    C --> D{Verified by Target Model}
    D -->|Accept| E[Keep Beam]
    D -->|Reject| F{Beam Search Correction}
    F --> G[Final Output]
    E --> G
```

- **Drafting**: Fast model (e.g., DistilGPT2) proposes multiple beams.
- **Verification**: Target model (e.g., GPT2 or GPT-J) checks validity.
- **Fallback**: Beam search is invoked on rejected branches to recover quality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speculative-beam-decoding.git
cd speculative-beam-decoding
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run a Sample

```bash
python experiments/run_ablation.py --prompt "The future of AI is"
```

## 📊 Evaluation

Metrics used:
- **Latency**: Tokens/sec
- **Perplexity** (on verified output)
- **BLEU / ROUGE** (on downstream summarization)
- **Beam diversity**

Compare:
- Greedy decoding
- Beam search
- Speculative decoding
- Speculative + beam hybrid

## 🏗️ Planned Features

- [ ] Multi-beam speculative validation
- [ ] Token-level fallback and correction
- [ ] GPU batch-mode speculative beam
- [ ] Web demo (Streamlit or Gradio)
- [ ] Integration with LLaMA2 or GPT-NeoX
